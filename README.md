**Biometric Safe Opening System with IoT**
**Description**
This project implements a secure safe opening system using ESP32 and Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor. It leverages multi-factor authentication for enhanced security and integrates real-time monitoring through ThingSpeak (cloud-based dashboard).

**Key Features**
- Fingerprint Authentication: Uses the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor for biometric identification.
- ESP32 Microcontroller: Handles the logic and communication between the sensor and the cloud.
- Real-time Monitoring: Data is displayed live on a ThingSpeak dashboard for tracking access attempts.
- Security: Multi-factor authentication for preventing unauthorized access.

**Technologies Used**
- C Programming Language
- ESP32
- Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor
- ThingSpeak for cloud-based monitoring

**Notes**
- Code was developed under tight time constraints with a focus on hardware integration.
- Not fully modularized due to time limitations. Would refactor for cleaner code if more time were available.

**Future Improvements**
- Refactor the code into smaller, more modular functions.
- Add more authentication methods for increased security.
- Expand the system to include multiple safes with independent access.
